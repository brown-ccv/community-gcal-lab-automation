# Phase 1 Complete! 🎉

Web interface is built and running locally. Here's what we have now:

## ✅ What's Working

### Web Interface
- **URL:** http://localhost:3000
- Clean, modern form interface
- Mobile-responsive design
- Real-time input validation
- Event preview before creation
- Success/error feedback
- Delete functionality built-in

### Features
- Create 1-day, 10-day, and 45-day check-in events
- Idempotent (won't create duplicates)
- Automatic email invites
- 30-minute event duration
- America/New_York timezone
- Delete test events easily

### Documentation Created
- `WEB_USER_GUIDE.md` - Simple guide for lab members
- `DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md` - Complete rollout plan
- `README.md` - Updated with web interface instructions
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `render.yaml` - Render.com deployment config

## 🧪 Testing Locally

The web server is currently running at http://localhost:3000

### To test:

1. **Visit the URL** in your browser
2. You'll be redirected to authorize with Google (first time only)
3. Complete the OAuth flow
4. Try creating test events:
   - Base Date: Tomorrow's date (e.g., 10/31/2025)
   - Title: TEST-001
   - Time: Current time + 1 hour
5. Check your calendar and email
6. Test the delete function

### To stop the server:
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

### To restart:
```bash
npm start
```

## 🚀 Next Steps (Phase 2)

Ready to deploy to Render.com? Here's what's needed:

### 1.2 Update OAuth Configuration (~5 minutes)
- [ ] Go to Google Cloud Console → Credentials
- [ ] Edit your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
- [ ] Add redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback`
- [ ] (Will add Render URL after deploy)

### 1.3 Prepare Repository (~10 minutes)
- [ ] Initialize git if not already done
- [ ] Commit all code
- [ ] Create GitHub repository
- [ ] Push code to GitHub

### Phase 2: Deploy to Render (~15 minutes)
- [ ] Create Render account
- [ ] Connect GitHub repo
- [ ] Configure web service
- [ ] Upload credentials.json as secret
- [ ] Update OAuth redirect URI with Render URL
- [ ] Test production deployment

## 📊 Commands Reference

```bash
# Start web server
npm start

# Start CLI (alternative)
npm run cli

# Development mode (auto-restart on changes)
npm run dev

# CLI delete mode
npm run cli -- --delete --date 11/10/2025 --title "TEST-001"
```

## 🎯 What Changed from CLI Version

**Before (CLI):**
- Terminal-based prompts
- Requires Node.js knowledge
- One user at a time
- Copy/paste commands

**Now (Web):**
- Browser-based form
- No technical knowledge needed
- Multiple users simultaneously
- Click buttons, see instant feedback

Both versions work! CLI is still available via `npm run cli`.

## 💡 Tips

- Keep the server running in a terminal tab
- The web interface is more user-friendly for non-technical lab members
- CLI is still useful for automation scripts
- Both use the same backend (auth.js & calendar.js)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **OAuth Setup Required:** If you haven't set up Google Calendar API credentials yet, follow `SETUP_GUIDE.md` first
2. **Local Only:** Currently runs on your computer. Phase 2 will make it accessible from anywhere
3. **One Authorization:** Once you authorize locally, the token is saved and you won't need to re-authorize
4. **Test Safely:** Use test data first, then clean up with the delete function

## 🤔 Questions?

**Want to deploy to Render.com now?** 
→ Continue to Phase 2 in `DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`

**Need to set up OAuth first?** 
→ Follow `SETUP_GUIDE.md`

**Lab members need instructions?** 
→ Share `WEB_USER_GUIDE.md`

**Want to customize?** 
→ See `CUSTOMIZATION.md`

**Phase 1 Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Time Taken:** ~45 minutes  
**Ready for Phase 2:** Yes! (after OAuth setup if not done)
